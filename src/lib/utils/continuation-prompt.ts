### **Handling the Beginning of the Novel (Special Instructions)**  
If there is **little or no prior context**, you must craft a compelling opening that sets the stage for the novel using the **story premise and main character descriptions**. Follow these best practices for an engaging first section:  

1. **Establish the Setting & Mood Naturally**  
   - Use sensory details (sights, sounds, atmosphere) to ground the reader in the world.  
   - Introduce a key element of the setting that hints at the story‚Äôs themes (e.g., a futuristic cityscape, a bustling caf√©, or a quiet suburban street).  

2. **Introduce the Protagonist in an Engaging Way**  
   - Show the main character in action, thinking, or interacting with their environment‚Äî**avoid passive introductions.**  
   - Subtly highlight their **core motivation or internal conflict** without excessive exposition.  

3. **Create an Intriguing Hook**  
   - Start with a moment of **curiosity, tension, or mystery** to draw the reader in.  
   - Instead of an info dump, reveal key details **organically through action or dialogue**.  

4. **Set Up the Story‚Äôs Direction**  
   - The opening should **hint at or introduce** the main conflict, without revealing everything at once.  
   - Ensure the first section leads naturally into the next scene, making the user‚Äôs first choice meaningful.  

‚úÖ **Example Good Story Openings:**  
- **(Intriguing Start)** Kai blinked at the skyline. No neon billboards, no AI surveillance drones‚Äîjust the dim glow of streetlamps. 2025. The year they sent him back to. **His second chance.**  
- **(Mystery Hook)** A phone buzzed in Kai‚Äôs pocket. But he hadn‚Äôt had a phone in years. **The screen flashed a message: "Welcome back. Don‚Äôt mess it up this time."**  
- **(Worldbuilding First)** The air smelled of fresh coffee and damp pavement, a stark contrast to the sterile, automated world Kai had left behind. **This was the past. His past.**  

üö´ **What to Avoid in Story Openings:**  
- **Generic ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù scenes with no direction.**  
- **Excessive exposition‚Äîlet details unfold naturally.**  
- **Starting with extreme action (e.g., immediate combat or chase) before establishing the protagonist and setting.**

5. **Scene Awareness & Environmental Interaction**  
   - Keep track of the **setting, objects, and ongoing actions** from previous sections.  
   - If a character was performing an action, ensure continuity (e.g., if someone was drinking coffee, don‚Äôt suddenly have them wielding a sword).  

6. **Maintain the Established Perspective**  
   - The novel follows **Third-Person Limited (Kai‚Äôs perspective)**‚Äîonly describe his thoughts, emotions, and observations.  
   - Other characters‚Äô thoughts should be inferred through their actions and dialogue.

     - **Genuine friendship moments** where characters have each other‚Äôs backs.
